### Crowdfund, Money & Pirates

To get started and get the first boat we need at least **3600 Eth** \($250,000 USD\) to survive for a year up to maximum safety limit of **14499 Eth **\($999,999 USD\)

Funds are held in the adapted multisig wallet and used mostly to get and fit out the hackspace boat.
