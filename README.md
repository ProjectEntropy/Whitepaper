# Project Entropy - Whitepaper

#### Intro

Entropy is a flotilla of Ethereum-directed hackspace boats that people can use to travel and to hangout and make stuff on.

The boats are maintained by people who hangout on them and sailed by people who can sail them with other people on them safely.

Where they sail and what they do \(and why they do it\) is decided by people on the boats, along with everyone who helped so far.
