### Hackspace

Hackspaces are something everyone should have access to, so Project Entropy aims to be a decentralised version of this which can travel easily and sustainably to help empower people in all parts of this world - even very remote. The main components of a hackspace is accessibility to an array of tools like power tools, electronics or sewing machines and a community around it to share your ideas, learnings, obstacles and inspiration with.

They allow for creativity, sharing knowledge and trialling and learning new stuff. It is a place where people are supported to build stuff that they think is valuable in many different ways, like projects around sustainability, open source or simply to make someone smile.
