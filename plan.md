## PLAN

To start things off and get the first boat a bunch of Ether can be collected in exchange for Entropy tokens.

To make a healthy, workable first version of the project, we need around $250,000 USD worth of Ether

###Â Timeline

##### Month 1: Gather
We plan to begin the crowdfund as soon as possible and run it for 3 weeks.

##### Month 2-4: Boats & Refit
Once funds are raised, Entropy will seek out or borrow secondhand yachts suitable for hackspace refit (let us know if you have one).
Need a lot of help here, bring paint & tools!

##### Month 5: Water
Once refit is done, take to the water for test sails, let crew and volunteers get used to the boats.
Work out problems, figure out offshore internet and solar systems. Make sure everything is safe.

##### Month 6-12 (Seasonally dependent): Voyage 1
Begin following suggested destinations, first offshore trip, first big events put on in remote location
Invite aboard chosen incubatable ideas & teams
Begin to think about survival for next year - sponsors, incubation, special trips

##### Year 2: Voyage 2
Improve and expand fleet so more can sail aboard at once. Diversify boats for different purposes, hackspace seeding,
plastic recycling. Become global nomadic movement.
Open source yacht designs, begin self fabricating more boats for other groups to join with.

### Contributors
Everyone who gets a token from Entropy becomes a contributor forever, even if they trade their token away.
