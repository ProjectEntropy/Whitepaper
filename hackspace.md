### Hackspace

The main components of a hackspace are accessibility to an array of tools like power tools, electronics or sewing machines and a community around it to share your ideas, learnings, obstacles and inspiration with. Hackspaces are something everyone should have access to, so Project Entropy aims to be a decentralised version of this which can travel easily and sustainably to help empower people in all parts of this world - even remote.

They allow for creativity, sharing knowledge and trialling and learning new stuff. It is a place where people are supported to build stuff that they think can be valuable in many different ways, like projects around sustainability, open source or simply to making someone smile.

A Hackspace on a boat makes sense as the project can reach remote areas sustainably and bring all the tools necessary with it. The project envisions to carry traditional power and hand tools as well as equipment to make 3D printers and CNC milling machines such as RepRap Printers and Maslow CNC the https://github.com/MaslowCNC
