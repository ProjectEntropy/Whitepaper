### Incubator

Following through from the idea of creating a floating village that encourages problem-solving and creativity, the project encourages members to join the boats for amounts of time to give them the chance to work on their projects. Surrounded by likeminded people that are up for experiments, members can work on their own projects. These projects are encouraged to be open-source and sustainable, the crowd will decide/prioritise which projects will come aboard if there is too many people interested at a time.
