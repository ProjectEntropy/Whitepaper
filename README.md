# Project Entropy - Dreams, Hopes & Aspirations

#### Intro

Entropy is part outreach, part incubator and part wild experiments.

We operate **Mobile hackspaces** to bring them to parts of the world that normally are left behind, but where really they can do much more good, with the aim of seeding permanent spaces for people to share tools and wisdom (https://projectentropy.gitbooks.io/whitepaper/content/hackspace.html)

We **support others building worth while open stuff** which makes the world better - the aim being to free groups from any sort of financial pressure for a while so they can create freely

The spaces, boats and vehicles we run work as **testbeds for trying out ideas** which don't necessarily need to make commercial sense
