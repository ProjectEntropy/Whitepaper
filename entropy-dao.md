### The Entropy DAO

Project Entropy is organised as a distributed autonomous organisation \(DAO\) to ensure that this project is owned and directed by the crowd instead of a select few.

Contributors to the project can become a member of the DAO. This can happen by either helping out to build the platform \(e.g. successful Github commits\) or contributing financially in the upcoming Crowdsale. In return the Ethereum wallet addresses of a member will be marked as citizens of the Project. As citizens they can use the online platform of the DAO to say where the project should go, what it should do and which other projects or ideas it should help.

#### Voting

Every citizen has one vote per proposed action and can propose actions themselves. These proposals can involve destinations for the boat, event ideas, ideas for projects to be done on the boat/journey and the election and unelection of guardians. The proposal can include an estimated budget needed which will be released if the proposal is accepted. The voting period is a minimum of 6 days long and needs a minimum of 6 votes casted. If the majority of casted votes is in favour of the proposal, the proposal is accepted and the proposed budget will be released to a multisig wallet accessible by the guardians.

#### Token and Shared Ownership

The crowdsale will not only issue markers against wallet addresses to identify financial contributors as citizens but also issue tokens. The token is called Shmekl \(SMKL\) is a standard ERC20 token.

#### Trust and Guardians

Project Entropy is designed to give as many people as possible access to itself, its hackspace and wider community. The project aims to give to the commons and not to the privileged. Such an infrastructure is susceptible to attack as the cost to attack is relatively low. That is why the project needs guardians - especially in its founding steps ahead - to deter Sybil Attacks. Guardians ensure that proposed budgets will not randomly get sent to external address as the voting system gets overpowered by fake accounts. They act as a buffer to make sure that proposed action budgets are legit use cases of members and forward approved budgets on. And they also confirm members individuality to allow them to vote.

This system does reintroduce a form of centralisation. This means that guardians have more power than the rest of the members albeit no access to all the funds. To minimise abuse of power guardians can be unvoted \(one at a time\) and other members put forward as a guardian to be voted for.
